* Inspiration
  This library is just [[https://github.com/Engelberg/better-cond][Mark Engelberg's better-cond]] but extensible. It
  also has some similarities to [[https://github.com/randomcorp/thread-first-thread-last-backwards-question-mark-as-arrow-cond-arrow-bang][Alex Engelberg and Derek Slager's
  ~->->><?as->cond->!~]]. I was also inspired by [[https://github.com/rplevy/swiss-arrows#the-back-arrow][swiss-arrows' ~<<-~]] and
  [[https://fare.livejournal.com/189741.html][François-René Rideau's ~nest~]] in that both seek to flatten Lisp that
  marches "down and to the right" – deeply-nested forms that can be
  hard to read.
